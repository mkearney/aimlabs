Packaging for deep learning text classification models

## aimlabs

A python package managed via poetry. The purpose of `aimlabs` is to
provide an interface for specifying and training text classification
models, primarily those that are fine-tuned from preexisting models
like BERT or distilbert.

## Models

There are a variety of models that can be fine tuned. Here are some
examples along with their bare bone parameters and sizes.
